## Design Guidelines

- Use Nexprove brand colors (neutral-950, accent colors from site)
- Maintain consistent typography with the website
- Include subtle Nexprove branding (logo or wordmark)
- Keep text large and readable when scaled down
- Ensure contrast meets accessibility standards
- Use clean, minimal designs that represent professionalism

## Testing

After creating images, test social sharing with:
- [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/)
- [Twitter Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)
- [LinkedIn Post Inspector](https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/)

## Current Status

⚠️ **All images are placeholders** - need to be designed and created before deployment for optimal social media sharing.

The pages will function without these images, but social sharing previews will not look professional.
